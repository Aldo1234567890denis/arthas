## 🎓 Learning Progression Logic

### **Why This Sequence Works**

1. **Foundation First** (0-3): Core concepts before advanced features
2. **Capability Building** (4-7): Essential features in dependency order
3. **Production Focus** (8-11): Security and scalability when fundamentals are solid
4. **Advanced Integration** (12-13): Optimization and ecosystem integration last
