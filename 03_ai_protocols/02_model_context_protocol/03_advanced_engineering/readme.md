# Advanced MCP Capabilities

## 🎯 Module Learning Objectives  
By completing this module, you will be able to:
1. **Master** all three advanced MCP client capabilities (sampling, elicitation, roots)
2. **Design** intelligent tools that combine AI reasoning, user interaction, and context awareness
3. **Implement** both stateful and stateless HTTP MCP servers appropriately
4. **Evaluate** when and how to use each capability for maximum effectiveness
5. **Build** production-ready MCP applications with proper architecture patterns

## 🧠 Core Philosophy: From Static to Intelligent Tools

**Traditional MCP Tools:** 
- Take parameters → Process → Return results
- Limited, predictable behavior
- No adaptation or learning

**Advanced MCP Tools:**
- **🧠 Can Think** (via sampling) - Delegate complex reasoning to AI
- **🤝 Can Interact** (via elicitation) - Have conversations with users  
- **📁 Can Adapt** (via roots) - Understand and work within user's context

This represents the evolution from simple automation to intelligent, adaptive AI assistants.

## Core Concepts of MCP Development

Throughout this module, we will explore:

### 📚 Progressive Skill Building

Each lesson builds on the previous, with hands-on exercises and real-world applications:

### **Stage 1: [01_sampling](./01_sampling/) - AI-Powered Reasoning**

**🎯 Core Question:** *"When should tools think vs. follow predefined logic?"*

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to delegate complex reasoning to client LLMs
- When AI delegation improves tool capabilities
- Building tools that adapt their behavior intelligently
- **Architecture:** Stateful HTTP for server-to-client requests

**🛠️ Hands-On Exercises:**
- Build a sentiment analysis tool using sampling
- Experiment with prompt engineering for different outputs
- Create multi-step AI reasoning workflows

**🏆 Success Criteria:** You can explain when and why to use AI delegation in tool design.

### **Stage 2: [02_elicitation](./02_elicitation/) - Interactive Experiences**

**🎯 Core Question:** *"How can tools become conversational and user-friendly?"*

**What You'll Learn:**
- Designing interactive, multi-step tool workflows  
- Various input types (text, select, boolean, etc.)
- Building user-friendly interfaces for complex operations
- **Architecture:** Stateful HTTP for multi-round-trip interactions

**🛠️ Hands-On Exercises:**  
- Design an interactive project setup wizard
- Build error handling for interrupted workflows
- Create conditional logic based on user responses

**🏆 Success Criteria:** You can design tools that feel like natural conversations.

---

### **Stage 3: [03_roots](./03_roots/) - Context Awareness**

**🎯 Core Question:** *"How can tools understand and work within project boundaries?"*

**What You'll Learn:**
- Building project-aware tools that discover context
- Working with file system boundaries securely
- Creating tools that adapt to different project structures
- **Architecture:** Flexible HTTP (stateful or stateless based on complexity)

**🛠️ Hands-On Exercises:**
- Build a project analysis tool using roots
- Design security controls for file system access
- Create tools that work across multiple project types

**🏆 Success Criteria:** You can build tools that "understand" user workspaces.

### **Stage 4**: Server Advanced Primitives

**[Server Primitives](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/server):** How servers define and offer:
    - **Tools:** Executable functions that an AI can request the server to run (e.g., call an API, query a database, perform a calculation).
    - **Resources:** Contextual data that an AI can read and use (e.g., file contents, database records, real-time information).
    - **Prompt Templates:** Pre-defined interaction patterns that guide the AI or user in achieving specific tasks with the server's capabilities.
2.  **Server Lifecycle:** Understanding how a server participates in the MCP session lifecycle, including initialization and capability negotiation with clients.
3.  **SDKs for Server Creation:** Primarily focusing on using the Python `[FastMCP](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk)` official library to build servers efficiently.
4.  **Configuration and Metadata:** How servers declare their identity and manage necessary configurations.

## Why MCP Servers are Vital for Agentic Engines (e.g., OpenAI Agents SDK)

Agentic engines, such as the OpenAI Agents SDK, are designed to enable AI models to perform complex tasks by reasoning, planning, and utilizing external tools. MCP Servers enhance these engines significantly:

- **Standardized Tool Integration:** Instead of custom, one-off integrations for every tool or data source, agentic engines can connect to any MCP-compliant server. This drastically simplifies the process of expanding an agent's capabilities.
- **Dynamic Capability Discovery:** Agents can query MCP Servers to discover available tools, resources, and prompts at runtime. This allows for more flexible and adaptive agent behavior.
- **Reduced Boilerplate:** Developers building agents don't need to write the low-level code for interacting with each external system if an MCP Server already exists for it.
- **Interoperability:** The same MCP Server can potentially serve different agentic engines or AI models, promoting a more open and interoperable ecosystem.
- **Enhanced Contextual Awareness:** By accessing resources through MCP Servers, agents can ground their reasoning and actions in relevant, up-to-date information.

## The Role of MCP Servers in the DACA (Dapr Agentic Cloud Ascent) Framework

One goal of DACA is to provide a scalable, resilient, and cost-efficient blueprint for agentic AI systems. MCP Servers are a natural fit within the DACA architecture:

- **AI Context Components:** MCP Servers can be implemented as individual microservices or components within DACA's business logic tier. Each server can encapsulate a specific domain capability (e.g., a GitHub MCP Server, a custom reusable MCP Server).
- **Leveraging Dapr:**
  - **Deployment & Scalability:** Dapr can be used to deploy, manage, and scale MCP Servers (especially remote/HTTP-based ones). Dapr sidecars can handle concerns like service discovery and secure communication.
  - **State Management:** For stateful MCP Servers (e.g., those managing resource subscriptions or session-specific data), Dapr's state management building block can provide reliable persistence.
  - **Pub/Sub:** Dapr's pub/sub mechanism can be used by MCP Servers to react to events or to publish notifications about resource changes, which clients might be subscribed to via MCP.
  - **Secrets Management:** Dapr's secrets building block can securely provide sensitive configuration (like API keys) to MCP Servers.
- **Open Core Philosophy:** Custom-built MCP Servers align with DACA's "Open Core" principle, providing foundational, reusable capabilities within the agentic system. These servers can then interact with "Managed Edges" (e.g., calling external managed APIs).
- **Interoperability in Agentia World:** MCP Servers are fundamental to the Agentia World vision, enabling standardized communication and capability sharing between diverse, distributed AI agents. The Streamable HTTP transport, making servers more flexible (including stateless operation), is particularly well-suited for DACA's cloud-native and scalable nature.
