# Working with Data 01: [Searching the Graph](https://help.getzep.com/graphiti/working-with-data/searching) - Hybrid Search and Advanced Retrieval

Welcome to Step 06! This step uses **Socratic questioning** and **Zone of Proximal Development** to master Graphiti's search capabilities.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this step, you will:
- Master hybrid search combining semantic, keyword, and graph-based retrieval
- Implement advanced search strategies for educational content
- Use reranking techniques for result optimization
- Design search recipes for specific educational scenarios
- Apply search analytics for learning insights

## üìö Core Concepts (Building on Namespacing)

### What is Hybrid Search?

**Hybrid Search** in Graphiti combines multiple search modalities to find the most relevant information:

1. **Semantic Search** - Understanding meaning and context
2. **Keyword Search (BM25)** - Traditional text matching
3. **Graph-Based Search** - Relationship traversal and community-aware retrieval
4. **Temporal Search** - Time-aware relevance

**Educational Power:**
- **Concept Discovery**: Find related learning concepts semantically
- **Precision Matching**: Exact terminology when needed
- **Learning Pathways**: Graph traversal reveals prerequisite chains
- **Historical Context**: Temporal search tracks learning progression

### Search Components in Graphiti

**Search Scope Options:**
- `scope='nodes'` - Search entities only
- `scope='edges'` - Search relationships only  
- `scope='both'` - Search entities and relationships (default)

**Reranking Strategies:**
- `reranker='mmr'` - Maximum Marginal Relevance (diversity)
- `reranker='cross_encoder'` - Deep semantic reranking
- `reranker='none'` - No additional reranking

**Search Filters:**
- `search_filters={'node_types': ['Student']}` - Filter by entity types
- `search_filters={'edge_types': ['ENROLLED_IN']}` - Filter by relationship types
- `community_ids=[...]` - Search within specific communities
- `group_id='...'` - Namespace-constrained search

## üìö Practice Problems (Zone of Proximal Development)

### Problem 1: Learning Path Discovery
**Scenario**: A student asks "What should I learn before attempting machine learning?"

**Your Task**: Design search strategies to:
1. Find prerequisite concepts using semantic search
2. Identify the optimal learning sequence
3. Locate students who successfully made this transition

### Problem 2: Personalized Content Recommendation
**Challenge**: Recommend learning materials based on a student's current knowledge and struggles.

**Your Task**:
1. Search for similar student learning patterns
2. Find content that helped students with similar difficulties
3. Use community-based search for contextual recommendations

### Problem 3: Instructor Analytics Dashboard
**Scenario**: An instructor wants insights into how students are progressing through course concepts.

**Your Task**:
1. Design searches to identify knowledge gaps
2. Find concepts students consistently struggle with
3. Discover successful learning interventions

## ‚úÖ Understanding Check (Socratic Method)

### Essential Questions
1. **Why** does hybrid search outperform single-modality search?
2. **When** would you use semantic vs. keyword search in education?
3. **How** do reranking strategies change search relevance?
4. **What** educational insights emerge from relationship-focused searches?

### Critical Thinking
1. **If** search results are too broad, how do you increase precision?
2. **What if** semantic search misses important exact terminology?
3. **How might** search strategies differ for different learning domains?

### Educational Applications
1. Design search for a student recommendation system
2. Create searches for instructor dashboard analytics
3. Plan search strategies for adaptive learning systems

## üéØ Next Steps

You now master the art of finding exactly what you need in complex knowledge graphs! You've learned:

‚úÖ **Hybrid search strategies** for educational content  
‚úÖ **Advanced filtering and reranking** techniques  
‚úÖ **Educational search recipes** for common scenarios  
‚úÖ **Search analytics** for learning insights  

**Ready for the next step?** Continue to **[07_crud_operations](../07_crud_operations/)** to learn direct manipulation of nodes and edges for precise knowledge graph management.

## üìù Key Takeaways

1. **Hybrid search is powerful** - Combines semantic, keyword, and graph-based retrieval
2. **Scope matters** - Nodes, edges, or both reveal different insights  
3. **Reranking optimizes relevance** - Cross-encoder and MMR serve different needs
4. **Filters add precision** - Entity types, communities, and namespaces focus results
5. **Educational recipes solve common needs** - Prerequisites, difficulties, success patterns
