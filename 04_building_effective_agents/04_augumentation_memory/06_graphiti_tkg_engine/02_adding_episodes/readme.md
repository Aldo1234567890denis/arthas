# [Core Concept 01: Adding Episodes](https://help.getzep.com/graphiti/core-concepts/adding-episodes) - Different Types of Data

Now that you've seen Graphiti work with simple text, let's explore the three types of episodes and when to use each one. Episodes are how you feed information into Graphiti.

## üéØ What You'll Learn

By the end of this step, you will:
- Understand the three episode types: text, message, and JSON
- Know when to use each episode type
- See how different data creates different knowledge structures
- Build a complete learning progression using episodes
- Handle bulk episode loading for large datasets

## üìö Core Concepts

### What are Episodes?

**Episodes** are Graphiti's fundamental input unit - they represent discrete pieces of information that occurred at a specific time. Think of them as "data events" that Graphiti processes to build your temporal knowledge graph.

**Key Properties:**
- `name`: Unique identifier for the episode
- `episode_body`: The actual content (text, conversation, or JSON)
- `source`: Type of episode (`EpisodeType.text`, `EpisodeType.message`, `EpisodeType.json`)
- `source_description`: Context about where this data came from
- `reference_time`: When this episode occurred
- `group_id`: (Optional) For multi-tenant isolation

So **Episodes** are the input format for Graphiti. Think of them as "events" or "pieces of information" that happened at a specific time. Graphiti processes episodes to extract entities and relationships.

### Entities (Nodes)
**Entities** are the "things" in your knowledge graph - people, places, concepts, objects. Graphiti automatically identifies these from your episode content.

### Relationships (Edges) 
**Relationships** connect entities and show how they're related. These are also automatically extracted and can evolve over time.

### The Three Episode Types

**Text Episodes** - For narrative content:
```python
episode_body = "Sarah completed her Python assignment and got an A grade."
source = EpisodeType.text
```

**Message Episodes** - For conversations:
```python
episode_body = (
    "Student: I don't understand loops\n"
    "Tutor: Let's break them down step by step\n"
    "Student: That helps, thank you!"
)
source = EpisodeType.message
```

**JSON Episodes** - For structured data:
```python
episode_body = {
    "student": "Sarah",
    "assignment": "Python Basics",
    "score": 95,
    "completed_date": "2024-01-15"
}
source = EpisodeType.json
```

**When to Use Each:**
- **Text**: Stories, descriptions, reports, articles
- **Message**: Conversations, chats, dialogues, interviews  
- **JSON**: Database records, API responses, structured forms

## üöÄ Worked Examples (Schaum's Method)

## üß™ Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Choose the Right Episode Type

For each scenario, pick the best episode type and explain why:

1. **Student course enrollment form** ‚Üí `?`
2. **Live tutoring session transcript** ‚Üí `?`  
3. **Quiz results from LMS API** ‚Üí `?`
4. **Student reflection essay** ‚Üí `?`
5. **Chatbot conversation log** ‚Üí `?`

**Answers:**
1. **JSON** - Structured form data with specific fields
2. **Message** - Back-and-forth conversation format
3. **JSON** - Structured data from an API  
4. **Text** - Narrative writing, personal reflection
5. **Message** - Dialogue between user and bot

### Exercise 2: Build a Learning Story

Create 3 episodes showing a student's progress over time:

```python
# Week 1 - Starting out (Text episode)
await client.add_episode(
    name="alice_week1",
    episode_body="Alice enrolled in Python 101. She has no programming experience but is eager to learn.",
    source=EpisodeType.text,
    reference_time=datetime.now() - timedelta(days=14)
)

# Week 2 - Getting help (Message episode)  
await client.add_episode(
    name="alice_week2",
    episode_body=(
        "Alice: I'm confused about variables\n"
        "Tutor: Think of variables as labeled boxes that store information\n"
        "Alice: Oh, that makes sense! Like a box labeled 'age' contains the number 25"
    ),
    source=EpisodeType.message,
    reference_time=datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7)
)

# Week 3 - Assessment results (JSON episode)
await client.add_episode(
    name="alice_week3",
    episode_body={
        "student": "Alice",
        "assessment": "Python Basics Quiz",
        "score": 85,
        "topics": ["variables", "loops", "functions"],
        "time_spent_minutes": 45
    },
    source=EpisodeType.json,
    reference_time=datetime.now()
)
```

### Problem 2: Temporal Progression Design
**Challenge**: Design a series of episodes showing a student's journey from beginner to expert in "Python Functions."

**Your Task**: Create 4 episodes spanning 3 weeks showing progression:
1. Initial confusion episode (text)
2. Tutoring breakthrough (message)  
3. First successful implementation (json assessment)
4. Teaching others (message)

### Problem 3: Bulk Episode Loading
**Scenario**: You have 1,000 student assessment records to load.

```python
# Your task: Complete this bulk loading implementation
async def load_assessment_data():
    assessments = load_from_database()  # Returns 1000 records
    
    # TODO: Convert to RawEpisode objects
    # TODO: Use add_episode_bulk for efficient loading
    # TODO: Include proper error handling
    
    pass
```

## üîß Advanced Techniques

### Bulk Episode Loading for Performance

When loading large datasets, use `add_episode_bulk`:

```python
from graphiti_core.nodes import RawEpisode
import json

async def efficient_bulk_loading():
    """Load 100s or 1000s of episodes efficiently"""
    
    # Prepare episodes
    raw_episodes = []
    for assessment in assessment_records:
        raw_episodes.append(RawEpisode(
            name=f"assessment_{assessment['id']}",
            content=json.dumps(assessment),
            source=EpisodeType.json,
            source_description="LMS assessment export",
            reference_time=datetime.fromisoformat(assessment['completed_at'])
        ))
    
    # Bulk load (much faster than individual add_episode calls)
    await client.add_episode_bulk(raw_episodes)
```

**Performance Benefits**:
- 10-100x faster for large datasets
- Optimized LLM batching
- Reduced API calls and database transactions

## ‚úÖ Understanding Check (Socratic Method)

Before proceeding, reflect on these questions:

### Essential Questions
1. **Why** does Graphiti need three different episode types?
2. **When** would you choose JSON over text episodes?
3. **How** does the temporal aspect (`reference_time`) enable learning insights?
4. **What** happens if you put conversation data in a text episode?

### Critical Thinking
1. **If** a student's understanding changes over time, how do episodes capture this evolution?
2. **What if** you have partially structured data (like a form with free-text fields)?
3. **How might** bulk loading affect the temporal ordering of knowledge extraction?

### Application Scenarios
1. Design episodes for a customer support knowledge base
2. Plan episode structure for a research paper analysis system  
3. Create episodes that track project collaboration over time

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Episode too large for LLM context"
**Problem**: Your JSON episode exceeds the LLM's context window
**Solution**: Break large JSON into smaller, focused episodes
```python
# Instead of one massive episode:
huge_assessment = {...}  # 10,000+ characters

# Create focused episodes:
await client.add_episode(name="student_profile", episode_body=assessment["student_info"], ...)
await client.add_episode(name="question_responses", episode_body=assessment["responses"], ...)
await client.add_episode(name="performance_metrics", episode_body=assessment["scores"], ...)
```

### Issue 2: "Message format not recognized"
**Problem**: Conversation episodes not extracting dialogue properly
**Solution**: Use proper `{role}: {message}` format
```python
# Correct format:
episode_body = (
    "Student: I don't understand loops.\n"
    "Tutor: Let's break it down step by step.\n" 
    "Student: That helps, thank you!"
)

# Incorrect format:
episode_body = "Student said they don't understand loops. Tutor explained step by step."
```

### Issue 3: "No entities extracted"
**Problem**: Episodes added but no graph entities created
**Solutions**:
1. **Check LLM configuration**: Verify OpenAI API key
2. **Wait for processing**: Allow time for async entity extraction
3. **Content quality**: Ensure episodes have meaningful, extractable content

## üìù What You Learned

Congratulations! You now understand how to use different episode types effectively:

### **Key Skills Gained**
‚úÖ **Episode Type Selection**: Choose the right format for your data
‚úÖ **Temporal Knowledge Building**: Use reference_time to show progression over time
‚úÖ **Bulk Loading**: Handle large datasets efficiently with `add_episode_bulk`
‚úÖ **Real-World Application**: Apply episodes to educational scenarios

### **When to Use Each Type**
- **Text Episodes**: For stories, descriptions, reports, and narrative content
- **Message Episodes**: For conversations, dialogues, and interactive content
- **JSON Episodes**: For structured data, API responses, and database records

## üéØ Next Steps

**Ready to make your knowledge graphs even more powerful?** Continue to **[03_custom_types](../03_custom_types/)** where you'll learn to define custom entities and relationships specific to your domain.

**What's Coming**: Instead of generic "entities" and "relationships", you'll create specific types like `Student`, `Course`, `ENROLLED_IN`, and `COMPLETED` that make your knowledge graphs much more precise and useful.

## üìö Key Takeaways

1. **Different data needs different episode types** - Choose based on structure
2. **Time matters** - Use reference_time to build temporal knowledge
3. **Episode quality affects graph quality** - Well-structured input creates better knowledge
4. **Bulk operations scale better** - Use `add_episode_bulk` for large datasets
5. **Mix and match** - Combine different episode types for comprehensive knowledge

---

**Practice makes perfect!** Try creating episodes from your own data before moving to the next step. The more you practice, the better you'll understand when to use each type. üöÄ

*"The best way to learn episodes is to experiment with your own data and see how different types create different knowledge structures."*
