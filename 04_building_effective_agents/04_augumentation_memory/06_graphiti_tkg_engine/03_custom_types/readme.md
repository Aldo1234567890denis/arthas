# [Core Concept 02: Custom Entity and Edge Types](https://help.getzep.com/graphiti/core-concepts/custom-entity-and-edge-types) - Making Knowledge Graphs Domain-Specific

Instead of generic "entities" and "relationships", you can define specific types for your domain. This makes your knowledge graphs much more precise and useful.

## üéØ What You'll Learn

By the end of this step, you will:
- Define custom entity types (like `Student`, `Course`, `Instructor`)
- Create custom relationship types (like `ENROLLED_IN`, `TEACHES`, `COMPLETED`)
- Use Pydantic models to add attributes to your types
- Apply custom types to episodes for better knowledge extraction
- Design a complete educational domain ontology

## üìö Core Concepts (Building on Episodes)

### Why Use Custom Types?

**Without Custom Types:**
```
Generic entities: "person", "thing", "concept"
Generic relationships: "relates_to", "connected_to"
```

**With Custom Types:**
```
Specific entities: Student, Course, Instructor, Assignment
Specific relationships: ENROLLED_IN, TEACHES, COMPLETED, STRUGGLES_WITH
```

**Benefits:**
- **More precise knowledge** - Know exactly what each entity represents
- **Better queries** - Search for specific types of information
- **Rich attributes** - Store domain-specific data on entities and relationships
- **Improved LLM extraction** - Guide the AI to find the right types of information

### How to Define Custom Types

Use Pydantic models to define your custom types:

**Custom Entity Example:**
```python
from graphiti_core.nodes import EntityNode
from pydantic import Field
from datetime import datetime

class Student(EntityNode):
    """A student in our educational system"""
    age: int = Field(..., description="Student's age")
    major: str = Field(..., description="Academic major")
    gpa: float = Field(..., description="Current GPA")
    enrollment_year: int = Field(..., description="Year enrolled")
```

**Custom Edge Example:**
```python
from graphiti_core.nodes import EntityEdge

class Enrollment(EntityEdge):
    """Relationship between student and course"""
    semester: str = Field(..., description="Fall 2024, Spring 2025, etc.")
    grade: str = Field(..., description="A, B, C, D, F")
    credits: int = Field(..., description="Credit hours")
```

**Key Points:**
- Inherit from `EntityNode` for entities, `EntityEdge` for relationships
- Use `Field()` to add descriptions and validation
- Add any attributes that make sense for your domain

## üöÄ Worked Examples (Schaum's Method)

### Example 1: Educational Domain Types

Let's build a comprehensive educational ontology:

```python
# educational_types.py
from datetime import datetime
from typing import Optional, List
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from graphiti_core.nodes import EntityNode, EntityEdge

# === ENTITY TYPES ===

    section_number: str = Field(..., description="Section identifier")
    class_size: int = Field(..., description="Number of enrolled students")

class SkillDevelopment(EntityEdge):
    """Student develops skill relationship"""
    proficiency_level: str = Field(..., description="Novice, developing, proficient, expert")
    assessment_date: datetime = Field(..., description="When proficiency was assessed")
    evidence_source: str = Field(..., description="Assignment, project, observation, etc.")

class Prerequisite(EntityEdge):
    """Course prerequisite relationship"""
    requirement_type: str = Field(..., description="Required, recommended, corequisite")
    can_waive: bool = Field(default=False, description="Whether prerequisite can be waived")

class Assessment_Performance(EntityEdge):
    """Student performance on assessment"""
    score_achieved: float = Field(..., description="Points earned")
    completion_time_minutes: Optional[int] = Field(None, description="Time taken")
    attempt_number: int = Field(default=1, description="Which attempt (if retakes allowed)")
    submission_date: datetime = Field(..., description="When assessment was submitted")
```

## üß™ Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Design Your Domain Types

**Scenario**: You're building a TutorsGPT system for a coding bootcamp.

**Your Task**: Define custom types for this domain:

**Entities needed:**
- `Bootcamp` - represents the program
- `Student` - represents learners
- `Mentor` - represents instructors
- `Project` - represents assignments

**Relationships needed:**
- `ENROLLED_IN` - student enrolled in bootcamp
- `MENTORS` - mentor teaches student  
- `ASSIGNED` - project assigned to student
- `COMPLETED` - student completed project

**Try it yourself:**
```python
class Bootcamp(EntityNode):
    duration_weeks: int = Field(..., description="Length of program")
    technology_focus: str = Field(..., description="Main technology taught")
    # Add more attributes...

class Student(EntityNode):
    # What attributes would be useful for a coding student?
    
class ENROLLED_IN(EntityEdge):
    # What information about enrollment would be useful?
```

### Exercise 2: Test Your Types

Add episodes using your custom types:

```python
# Define your types
entity_types = {
    "Bootcamp": Bootcamp,
    "Student": Student,
    "Mentor": Mentor
}

edge_types = {
    "ENROLLED_IN": ENROLLED_IN,
    "MENTORS": MENTORS
}

# Use them in episodes
await client.add_episode(
    name="bootcamp_enrollment",
    episode_body="Sarah enrolled in the 12-week Python bootcamp taught by mentor Jake.",
    source=EpisodeType.text,
    entity_types=entity_types,
    edge_types=edge_types
)
```

### Problem 2: Type Migration
**Challenge**: You have existing episodes without custom types. How do you add types retroactively?

**Your Task**: 
1. Design a migration strategy
2. Consider what data might be lost
3. Plan for backward compatibility

### Problem 3: Advanced Educational Ontology
**Scenario**: Design types for a complex educational scenario with:
- Multiple learning pathways
- Prerequisite chains
- Competency-based assessment
- Peer collaboration

## üîß Advanced Techniques

### Type Constraints and Validation

```python
from pydantic import validator, root_validator

class Student(EntityNode):
    age: int = Field(..., description="Student age")
    gpa: Optional[float] = Field(None, description="GPA")
    
    @validator('age')
    def age_must_be_reasonable(cls, v):
        if v < 16 or v > 65:
            raise ValueError('Age must be between 16 and 65 for students')
        return v
    
    @validator('gpa')
    def gpa_must_be_valid(cls, v):
        if v is not None and (v < 0.0 or v > 4.0):
            raise ValueError('GPA must be between 0.0 and 4.0')
        return v
```

### Dynamic Type Selection

```python
async def smart_episode_processing(episode_content: str):
    """Dynamically choose types based on content analysis"""
    
    # Analyze content to determine likely domain
    if "student" in episode_content.lower() and "course" in episode_content.lower():
        entity_types = {"Student": Student, "Course": Course}
        edge_types = {"Enrollment": Enrollment}
    elif "assessment" in episode_content.lower():
        entity_types = {"Assessment": Assessment, "Student": Student}
        edge_types = {"Performance": Assessment_Performance}
    else:
        entity_types = {}  # Use default extraction
        edge_types = {}
    
    await client.add_episode(
        name="smart_typed_episode",
        episode_body=episode_content,
        source=EpisodeType.text,
        entity_types=entity_types,
        edge_types=edge_types
    )
```

## ‚úÖ Understanding Check (Socratic Method)

### Essential Questions
1. **Why** are custom types more powerful than generic entity extraction?
2. **When** should you define a new entity type vs. using attributes?
3. **How** do custom edge types change the semantic meaning of relationships?
4. **What** happens to existing data when you introduce new types?

### Critical Thinking
1. **If** you have overlapping entity types (Student vs. Person), how do you handle classification?
2. **What if** your domain evolves and you need to add new attributes to existing types?
3. **How might** custom types affect query performance and storage?

### Design Challenges
1. Design types for a medical education system (patients, procedures, competencies)
2. Create types for a corporate training platform (employees, skills, certifications)
3. Model types for a research collaboration network (researchers, papers, citations)

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Type inheritance conflicts"
**Problem**: Multiple inheritance or conflicting type definitions
**Solution**: Use composition over inheritance and clear type hierarchies

### Issue 2: "Attribute validation errors"
**Problem**: Pydantic validation fails during episode processing
**Solution**: Add proper validators and handle edge cases

### Issue 3: "Migration breaking existing queries"
**Problem**: Adding types changes how existing data is interpreted
**Solution**: Plan migration carefully with backward compatibility

## üìù What You Learned

Congratulations! You now know how to create domain-specific knowledge graphs:

### **Key Skills Gained**
‚úÖ **Custom Entity Types**: Define specific types like `Student`, `Course`, `Instructor`
‚úÖ **Custom Relationship Types**: Create precise relationships like `ENROLLED_IN`, `TEACHES`
‚úÖ **Pydantic Models**: Add attributes and validation to your types
‚úÖ **Type Application**: Use custom types in episodes for better extraction
‚úÖ **Domain Design**: Think systematically about your knowledge domain

### **Benefits of Custom Types**
- **Precision**: Know exactly what each entity represents
- **Rich Data**: Store domain-specific attributes on entities and relationships
- **Better Queries**: Search for specific types of information
- **Guided Extraction**: Help the LLM find the right information

## üéØ Next Steps

**Ready to see patterns emerge automatically?** Continue to **[04_communities](../04_communities/)** where you'll learn how Graphiti automatically discovers groups and clusters in your knowledge graphs.

**What's Coming**: Instead of manually organizing information, you'll see how Graphiti finds related entities and groups them into "communities" - like discovering that certain students always struggle with the same topics, or that certain teaching methods work well together.

## üìö Key Takeaways

1. **Custom types make graphs more useful** - Domain-specific is better than generic
2. **Pydantic provides structure** - Use it to define your entities and relationships
3. **Start simple** - Begin with basic types and add complexity gradually
4. **Types guide extraction** - Help the LLM understand what to look for
5. **Think about your domain** - What entities and relationships matter most?

---

**Design tip**: Start with the most important entities in your domain (like `Student` and `Course` for education) and add more types as you discover what you need. Don't try to model everything at once! üöÄ

*"The best custom types emerge from understanding your domain deeply and starting with the most essential entities and relationships."*
